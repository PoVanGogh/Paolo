        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h2>My name is Paolo Marinos, I am a level 9,000 audio wizard, trained in production, recording, studio and stage technologies. My dream job is to produce music for film or gaming. I have my own podcast, I make music and enjoy video gaming. I play counter strike because it is a real man's game! I also tend to enjoy "Hello Kitty: Island Adventure" after a long day. Enjoy my website, visit my gallery where I have posted some silly and cool screenshots among other things of my interest!</h2>
